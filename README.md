# Code-Refactor

## Task: Cleaning Up Formatting of Existing Code
* Goal: To properly analyze a given set of HTML and CSS files, then deduce what changes need to be implimented in order to make them more presentable. These changes need to follow the general rules of HTML and CSS syntax such that a coder who opens these files will be able to better understand them. 
* Specifications: The files must maintain the same level of function that they had previously. This includes formatting and ensuring that all links still work properly. 
* Points of Emphasis: Accessability functions are vital to this assignment, therefore ensuring that images contain alt tags is important. The HTML page must be presented in an easy to follow manner, and the CSS must be in neat order and consolidated when possible. 
* Completion: This project is completed when fully functioning HTML, CSS, and READ.ME files are pushed and submitted into a github repository. Then the Link is shown here: https://mitchellm27.github.io/Code-Refactor/
